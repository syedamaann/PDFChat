As a student, I needed a way to quickly revisit my lecture notes, get specific explanations, and quiz myself to streamline my study workflow. While you can do this directly on ChatGPT, I thought it would be fun to build a lightweight application for this purpose. 

The app uses LangChain for orchestration, Streamlit for the UI, Ollama to run the LLM, and Neo4j to store vectors for efficient information retrieval. Docker is used for easy deployment and scalability.
